                    "content":"One of the current objections to Communism, and Socialism altogether, is\nthat the idea is so old, and yet it has never been realized. Schemes of\nideal States haunted the thinkers of Ancient Greece; later on, the early\nChristians joined in communist groups; centuries later, large communist\nbrotherhoods came into existence during the Reform movement. Then, the\nsame ideals were revived during the great English and French\nRevolutions; and finally, quite lately, in 1848, a revolution, inspired\nto a great extent with Socialist ideals, took place in France. \"And yet,\nyou see,\" we are told, \"how far away is still the realization of your\nschemes. Don't you think that there is some fundamental error in your\nunderstanding of human nature and its needs?\"\nAt first sight this objection seems very serious. However, the moment we\nconsider human history more attentively, it loses its strength. We see,\nfirst, that hundreds of millions of men have succeeded in maintaining\namongst themselves, in their village communities, for many hundreds of\nyears, one of the main elements of Socialism--the common ownership of\nthe chief instrument of production, the land, and the apportionment of\nthe same according to the labour capacities of the different families;\nand we learn that if the communal possession of the land has been\ndestroyed in Western Europe, it was not from within, but from without,\nby the governments which created a land monopoly in favour of the\nnobility and the middle classes. We learn, moreover, that the medieval\ncities succeeded in maintaining in their midst, for several centuries in\nsuccession, a certain socialized organization of production and trade;\nthat these centuries were periods of a rapid intellectual, industrial,\nand artistic progress; while the decay of these communal institutions\ncame mainly from the incapacity of men of combining the village with the\ncity, the peasant with the citizen, so as jointly to oppose the growth\nof the military states, which destroyed the free cities.\nThe history of mankind, thus understood, does not offer, then, an\nargument against Communism. It appears, on the contrary, as a succession\nof endeavours to realize some sort of communist organization, endeavours\nwhich were crowned here and there with a partial success of a certain\nduration; and all we are authorized to conclude is, that mankind has not\nyet found the proper form for combining, on communistic principles,\nagriculture with a suddenly developed industry and a rapidly growing\ninternational trade. The latter appears especially as a disturbing\nelement, since it is no longer individuals only, or cities, that enrich\nthemselves by distant commerce and export; but whole nations grow rich\nat the cost of those nations which lag behind in their industrial\ndevelopment.\nThese conditions, which began to appear by the end of the eighteenth\ncentury, took, however, their full development in the nineteenth century\nonly, after the Napoleonic wars came to an end. And modern Communism has\nto take them into account.\nIt is now known that the French Revolution, apart from its political\nsignificance, was an attempt made by the French people, in 1793 and\n1794, in three different directions more or less akin to Socialism. It\nwas, first, the equalization of fortunes, by means of an income tax\nand succession duties, both heavily progressive, as also by a direct\nconfiscation of the land in order to sub-divide it, and by heavy war\ntaxes levied upon the rich only. The second attempt was a sort of\nMunicipal Communism as regards the consumption of some objects of\nfirst necessity, bought by the municipalities, and sold by them at cost\nprice. And the third attempt was to introduce a wide national system of\nrationally established prices of all commodities, for which the real\ncost of production and moderate trade profits had to be taken into\naccount. The Convention worked hard at this scheme, and had nearly\ncompleted its work, when reaction took the upper hand.\nIt was during this remarkable movement, which has never yet been\nproperly studied, that modern Socialism was born--Fourierism with\nL'Ange, at Lyons, and authoritarian Communism with Buonarroti, Babeuf,\nand their comrades. And it was immediately after the Great Revolution\nthat the three great theoretical founders of modern Socialism--Fourier,\nSaint Simon, and Robert Owen, as well as Godwin (the No-State\nSocialism)--came forward; while the secret communist societies,\noriginated from those of Buonarroti and Babeuf, gave their stamp to\nmilitant, authoritarian Communism for the next fifty years.\nTo be correct, then, we must say that modern Socialism is not yet a\nhundred years old, and that, for the first half of these hundred years,\ntwo nations only, which stood at the head of the industrial movement,\ni.e., Britain and France, took part in its elaboration. Both--bleeding\nat that time from the terrible wounds inflicted upon them by fifteen\nyears of Napoleonic wars, and both enveloped in the great European\nreaction that had come from the East.\nIn fact, it was only after the Revolution of July, 1830, in France, and\nthe Reform movement of 1830-1832 in this country, had begun to shake off\nthat terrible reaction, that the discussion of Socialism became possible\nfor a few years before the revolution of 1848. And it was during those\nyears that the aspirations of Fourier, St. Simon, and Robert Owen,\nworked out by their followers, took a definite shape, and the different\nschools of Socialism which exist nowadays were defined.\nIn Britain, Robert Owen and his followers worked out their schemes of\ncommunist villages, agricultural and industrial at the same time;\nimmense co-operative associations were started for creating with their\ndividends more communist colonies; and the Great Consolidated Trades'\nUnion was founded--the forerunner of both the Labour Parties of our\ndays and the International Working-men's Association.\nIn France, the Fourierist Considerant issued his remarkable manifesto,\nwhich contains, beautifully developed, all the theoretical\nconsiderations upon the growth of Capitalism, which are now described as\n\"Scientific Socialism.\" Proudhon worked out his idea of Anarchism and\nMutualism, without State interference. Louis Blanc published his\nOrganization of Labour, which became later on the programme of\nLassalle. Vidal in France and Lorenz Stein in Germany further developed,\nin two remarkable works, published in 1846 and 1847 respectively, the\ntheoretical conceptions of Considerant; and finally Vidal, and\nespecially Pecqueur, developed in detail the system of Collectivism,\nwhich the former wanted the National Assembly of 1848 to vote in the\nshape of laws.\nHowever, there is one feature, common to all Socialist schemes of that\nperiod, which must be noted. The three great founders of Socialism who\nwrote at the dawn of the nineteenth century were so entranced by the\nwide horizons which it opened before them, that they looked upon it as a\nnew revelation, and upon themselves as upon the founders of a new\nreligion. Socialism had to be a religion, and they had to regulate its\nmarch, as the heads of a new church. Besides, writing during the period\nof reaction which had followed the French Revolution, and seeing more\nits failures than its successes, they did not trust the masses, and they\ndid not appeal to them for bringing about the changes which they thought\nnecessary. They put their faith, on the contrary, into some great ruler,\nsome Socialist Napoleon. He would understand the new revelation; he\nwould be convinced of its desirability by the successful experiments of\ntheir phalansteries, or associations; and he would peacefully accomplish\nby his own authority the revolution which would bring well-being and\nhappiness to mankind. A military genius, Napoleon, had just been ruling\nEurope. Why should not a social genius come forward, carry Europe with\nhim and translate the new Gospel into life? That faith was rooted very\ndeep, and it stood for a long time in the way of Socialism; its traces\nare even seen amongst us, down to the present day.\nIt was only during the years 1840-48, when the approach of the\nRevolution was felt everywhere, and the proletarians were beginning to\nplant the banner of Socialism on the barricades, that faith in the\npeople began to enter once more the hearts of the social schemers:\nfaith, on the one side, in Republican Democracy, and on the other side\nin free association, in the organizing powers of the working-men\nthemselves.\nBut then came the Revolution of February, 1848, the middle-class\nRepublic, and--with it, shattered hopes. Four months only after the\nproclamation of the Republic, the June insurrection of the Paris\nproletarians broke out, and it was crushed in blood. The wholesale\nshooting of the working-men, the mass deportations to New Guinea, and\nfinally the Napoleonian coup d'etat followed. The Socialists were\nprosecuted with fury, and the weeding out was so terrible and so\nthorough that for the next twelve or fifteen years the very traces of\nSocialism disappeared; its literature vanished so completely that even\nnames, once so familiar before 1848, were entirely forgotten; ideas\nwhich were then current--the stock ideas of the Socialists before\n1848--were so wiped out as to be taken, later on, by our generation, for\nnew discoveries.\nHowever, when a new revival began, about 1866, when Communism and\nCollectivism once more came forward, it appeared that the conception as\nto the means of their realization had undergone a deep change. The old\nfaith in Political Democracy was dying out, and the first principles\nupon which the Paris working-men agreed with the British trade-unionists\nand Owenites, when they met in 1862 and 1864, at London, was that \"the\nemancipation of the working-men must be accomplished by the working-men\nthemselves.\" Upon another point they also were agreed. It was that the\nlabour unions themselves would have to get hold of the instruments of\nproduction, and organize production themselves. The French idea of the\nFourierist and Mutualist \"Association\" thus joined hands with Robert\nOwen's idea of \"The Great Consolidated Trades' Union,\" which was\nextended now, so as to become an International Working-men's\nAssociation.\nAgain this new revival of Socialism lasted but a few years. Soon came\nthe war of 1870-71, the uprising of the Paris Commune--and again the\nfree development of Socialism was rendered impossible in France. But\nwhile Germany accepted now from the hands of its German teachers, Marx\nand Engels, the Socialism of the French \"forty-eighters\" that is, the\nSocialism of Considerant and Louis Blanc, and the Collectivism of\nPecqueur,--France made a further step forward.\nIn March, 1871, Paris had proclaimed that henceforward it would not wait\nfor the retardatory portions of France: that it intended to start within\nits Commune its own social development.\nThe movement was too short-lived to give any positive result. It\nremained communalist only; it merely asserted the rights of the Commune\nto its full autonomy. But the working-classes of the old International\nsaw at once its historical significance. They understood that the free\ncommune would be henceforth the medium in which the ideas of modern\nSocialism may come to realization. The free agro-industrial communes, of\nwhich so much was spoken in England and France before 1848, need not be\nsmall phalansteries, or small communities of 2000 persons. They must be\nvast agglomerations, like Paris, or, still better, small territories.\nThese communes would federate to constitute nations in some cases, even\nirrespectively of the present national frontiers (like the Cinque Ports,\nor the Hansa). At the same time large labour associations would come\ninto existence for the inter-communal service of the railways, the\ndocks, and so on.\nSuch were the ideas which began vaguely to circulate after 1871 amongst\nthe thinking working-men, especially in the Latin countries. In some\nsuch organization, the details of which life itself would settle, the\nlabour circles saw the medium through which Socialist forms of life\ncould find a much easier realization than through the seizure of all\nindustrial property by the State, and the State organization of\nagriculture and industry.\nThese are the ideas to which I have endeavoured to give a more or less\ndefinite expression in this book.\nLooking back now at the years that have passed since this book was\nwritten, I can say in full conscience that its leading ideas must have\nbeen correct. State Socialism has certainly made considerable progress.\nState railways, State banking, and State trade in spirits have been\nintroduced here and there. But every step made in this direction, even\nthough it resulted in the cheapening of a given commodity, was found to\nbe a new obstacle in the struggle of the working-men for their\nemancipation. So that we find growing amongst the working-men,\nespecially in Western Europe, the idea that even the working of such a\nvast national property as a railway-net could be much better handled by\na Federated Union of railway employes, than by a State organization.\nOn the other side, we see that countless attempts have been made all\nover Europe and America, the leading idea of which is, on the one side,\nto get into the hands of the working-men themselves wide branches of\nproduction, and, on the other side, to always widen in the cities the\ncircles of the functions which the city performs in the interest of its\ninhabitants. Trade-unionism, with a growing tendency towards organizing\nthe different trades internationally, and of being not only an\ninstrument for the improvement of the conditions of labour, but also of\nbecoming an organization which might, at a given moment, take into its\nhands the management of production; Co-operation, both for production\nand for distribution, both in industry and agriculture, and attempts at\ncombining both sorts of co-operation in experimental colonies; and\nfinally, the immensely varied field of the so-called Municipal\nSocialism--these are the three directions in which the greatest amount\nof creative power has been developed lately.\nOf course, none of these may, in any degree, be taken as a substitute\nfor Communism, or even for Socialism, both of which imply the common\npossession of the instruments of production. But we certainly must look\nat all these attempts as upon experiments--like those which Owen,\nFourier, and Saint Simon tried in their colonies--experiments which\nprepare human thought to conceive some of the practical forms in which a\ncommunist society might find its expression. The synthesis of all these\npartial experiments will have to be made some day by the constructive\ngenius of some one of the civilized nations. But samples of the bricks\nout of which the great synthetic building will have to be built, and\neven samples of some of its rooms, are being prepared by the immense\neffort of the constructive genius of man."
